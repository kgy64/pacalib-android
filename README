PaCaLib-Android: my 2D rendering library implementation for Android
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an object-oriented interface to draw graphics primitives including lines, circles, text, etc...

Based on the following external libraries:
- makesys   https://github.com/kgy64/makesys.git        My build system
- baselib   https://github.com/kgy64/baselib.git        My basic library

It uses the built-in Java classes as graphics interface.
Also uses Java-caller classes from Baselib.
